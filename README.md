# ETL_Customer_Behavior

# ETL Pipeline for Customer Behavior Analytics

## üìå Project Overview
This project simulates an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** that processes **clickstream, transaction, and CRM data** to build a **Customer 360 view**.  
The pipeline demonstrates how businesses can centralize raw data, transform it for analytics, and create BI-ready datasets for dashboards and personalization.

Built entirely in **Python (on Google Colab)** so it can be reproduced **without paid tools** like Airflow or managed warehouses.
